            Bitcoins is that it is better than Gold
          </h1>
          <p>
            Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that you can buy, sell and exchange directly, 
            without an intermediary like a bank. Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, originally described the need for “an electronic payment system based on
             cryptographic proof instead of trust".
            <p>
              Each and every Bitcoin transaction that’s ever been made exists on a public ledger accessible to everyone, making transactions hard to reverse and difficult to fake. 
              That’s by design: Core to their decentralized nature, 
              Bitcoins aren’t backed by the government or any issuing institution, and there’s nothing to guarantee their value besides the proof baked in the heart of the system.
            </p>
            <p>Since its public launch in 2009, Bitcoin has risen 
              dramatically in value. Although it once sold for under 
              $150 per coin, as of March 1, 2021, one Bitcoin now sells
               for almost $50,000. Because its supply is limited to 21 
               million coins, many expect its price to only keep rising as time goes on, 
               especially as more large, institutional investors begin treating it as a sort of digital gold 
              to hedge against market volatility and inflation.</p>
